	<p class="lead"><img src="images/aboutus.jpg" style="border-radius: 8px; float:left;width:195px;height:173px; padding: 0px 15px 10px 0px; font-size: 11px;">
	Hello Everyone, I am glad to introduce myself and tell you more about my education, work experience I have. I developed this website for demonstration and informative purposes so that everyone could get to know me better and take a look at the projects I have done so far. This website was developed from the scratch without using Word Press or any other content management tools.<br /> 
	As for me, I am originally from Eastern part of Russia, from Siberia. I am from big city Irkutsk with population of about 600,000 people. The city is located very close to the biggest fresh water lake Baikal which are not far from Mongolia and China as you can see on this <a href="http://maps.google.com/?ll=52.285864,104.305733&z=9" target="_blank">Google Map</a>.<br /> 
	I have always been interested in computer technologies and when I was in Russia I got my first Bachelor’s Degree in Information Systems and Economics. Beside just education I have also worked on improving my professional skills on practice. My first job in Russia was related with network support and configuration. I always wanted to move forward and get more achievements in my life. Right after graduation from Russia College I improved the knowledge of my English language, passed all necessary exams in order to continue my education in the United States. So I came to Fargo, North Dakota in July of 2007 and started education at Minnesota State University Moorhead. Since I already had Bachelor’s degree from Russian College, I transferred my main courses from my prior degree to MSUM and focused only on computer science classes. As a result of this, I was able to get my second Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Information Systems from MSUM in two years only. While I was still in college I also worked for North Dakota Trade Office as a Computer Specialist. I assisted the company with various projects such as website development and computer support. After I graduated from MSUM I was hired by Titan Machinery as a help desk and network support specialist. I answered phone calls and resolved different technical questions over the phone and in person. After working for Titan Machinery for one year I was then promoted to another position to work as a Program Analyst on their new Enterprise Resource Planning system – JD Edwards Oracle E1. I was in charge of getting requirements from company employees, writing technical documentation and developing different applications, reports for JD Edwards ERP system. I worked for Titan Machinery almost 6 years as a Program Analyst and after their ERP system was successfully implemented I decided to move forward and get more advanced degree at North Dakota State University. Currently, I purse Master of Software Engineering degree at NDSU and I also work at Swanson Health Products as an International Account Specialist. Since Swanson provided form me flexible work hours this company became an excellent place for me to work while getting my master degree at NDSU. Working with customers on the international level and processing their bulk orders, I was also able to get very valuable and interesting work experience at Swanson that I have never had before.<br /> 
    Beside school and work, I also take active part in different computer related events in Fargo such as local hackathons and game development competitions. I have been involved in two hackathon events where I proposed the applications: <a href="http://www.nutrilookup.com", target="_blank"><b>nutrilookup</b></a> and <a href="http://www.andreyv.info/cassCounty.html", target="_blank"><b>censusApp</b></a>. Beside this, I was also involved in one game development event in Fargo where I implemented <a href="projects.html", target="blank"><b>“Moby Dick”</b></a> video game, developed based on C# programming language and Unity Studio Tools. You can find all my projects in the project section. For more information about my education and work experience please see my resume and school transcripts below:<br />

		State Reserves of Russian Federation is Government Company that stores and maintains various reserves in case of any unexpected hazard incidents such as floods, storms and economic downfalls – anything that can significantly damage the local region and population. In case of any hazard incidents, the Federal Reserve provides necessary support to the local community. I worked for one of such agencies, located in my home city Irkutsk.

      <div class="modal-body">
        <p style="font-size: 16px; text-align: justify;">Titan Machinery is one of the largest distributors of Case IH and New Holland agricultural and constructions equipment in the US. At the time, when I graduate from college in 2009 Titan Machinery already had about 60 stores and was one of the fastest growing companies in Midwest area. Since the company was expanding quickly they needed IT specialists who could support their information technologies at their corporate office and at their stores. I started working for Titan Machinery as a help desk specialist during my last semester when I was still in college in the spring of 2009. I provided technical support over the phone and in person for company employees on questions related with local computers and network configuration. Since the company was constantly acquiring stores in different states they needed their IT specialists to set up the networks at the new stores. As a result of this, along with other coworkers from IT department I was involved in business trips to set up networks and computers at company stores. Due to fast growth Titan Machinery headquarters also decided to replace their ERP system to make their business more efficient. One year later after working as IT help desk specialist I was promote to work as Program Analyst on their new ERP System - JD Edwards Oracle. I worked with company employees on the changes that they needed to make in the new ERP system and, according to their requests, developed different reports, applications in JD Edward Oracle System. For more information about the projects I implemented for JD Edwards Oracle please see my project section on the website.

		Swanson Health Products is one of the biggest companies in Fargo that produce and sell healthy vitamins. The company has the plant located in south Fargo, one store in Fargo downtown and several warehouses in other states. I began to work for Swanson Health Products as an International Account Specialist right when I started my graduate school at NDSU, at the begging of 2015. Since I have always been interested in improvement of my qualification and getting more knowledge in the field of my specialization I decided to get more advanced, master degree in Software Engineering at NDSU. Swanson Health Products became the excellent company where I was allowed to work flexible hours and progress on my master degree quickly. Since I was hired to work for Swanson as an international account specialist I became in charge of different international customers, located in different parts of the world. I receive bulk orders from international customers and go through many steps of processing their orders until the requested products are delivered to the destination. While managing the orders, I have to stay in touch with customers, Swanson purchasing and warehouse departments. I arrange freight couriers and provide necessary documentation along with shipping products. Beside the international work, I also assist international department with various technical questions related with their software and PCs.
