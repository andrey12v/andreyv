		<p style="font-family: ProfsetITFont; font-size: 30px; text-align: center;">How can the functional requirements be affected by each non-functional requirement?  Why would this documentation be useful?</p>
		<p class="lead" style="font-size: 17px; ">
			Non-functional requirements can have significant impact on functional requirements and, as a result of this, can lead to changes in other documents such as architecture, detail design, technical specifications and legal regulations. The impact of non-functional on functional requirements could change the design of the system on different levels from the architectural viewpoint to its implementation. That’s why it is important to provide clear documentation of functional requirements being affected by each non-functional one.<br/> 
			In reality, it might be difficult to track and document the relationship between functional and non-functional requirements. Non-functional requirements may affect the overall architecture of the system rather than the individual components so that it might get harder to associate all affected components to every single non-functional requirement. Nonetheless, by means of certain practices the functional requirements affected by nonfunctional one could be documented in the following way:</p>
		<ul style="font-size: 17px; text-align: justify; list-style-image: url('blog/checkmark3.jpg');">
			<li>Nonfunctional and functional requirements should be documented in one requirement specification instead of splitting them into separate functional and non-functional requirements. Since some functional requirements are very hard to match with non-functional ones, separating them into different documents will create additional ambiguities and difficulties to trace them.</li> 
            <li>Whenever possible, non-functional requirements should be defined quantitatively so that they can be tested and matched with functional requirements. For example, the performance could be measured as responsiveness under a workload. By means of such approach, it is easier to determine and document the quality of functional requirements being affected by non-functional one.</li>
            <li>Nonfunctional and functional requirements should be clarified on user-level and system-level documentation for better understanding by different stakeholders.</li>
            <li>Functional requirements being affected by nonfunctional one (their changes) should be recorded in the traceability log for historical and reference purposes.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p class="lead" style="font-size: 17px; ">Functional and nonfunctional requirements should be clearly documented for the following reasons:</p>
		
		<ul style="font-size: 17px; text-align: justify; list-style-image: url('blog/checkmark3.jpg');">
			<li>Without proper documentation affected functional requirements could be just missed and determined only on the last stages of software development life cycle. As a result of this, the software product might be implemented with wrong functionality, that doesn’t correspond to customers’ requirements. </li>   
            <li>Without proper documentation stakeholders might understand the requirements differently which can even lead to more misunderstanding with all other members of the software development process. For example, business analysts might think about increased security level as simple username and password authentication; system analysts and software engineers will try to design the security as multi-layer process of entering an authentication code, username and password; developers might think about increased security as additional encryption algorithms that they would have to implement.</li>
            <li>It might be difficult to associate functional requirements with every nonfunctional requirement. When a nonfunctional requirement affects the overall system and many components then it might be hard to identify every single function in the system which was affected by it. If any of the functional requirements are not determined and clearly documented then it could lead to the wrong implementation of functional and nonfunctional requirements. For example, if a nonfunctional requirement such as performance is changed and not all functional requirements are clearly defined then the final product might not have desirable performance.</li>
